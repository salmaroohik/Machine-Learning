# Machine-Learning


Our project involves restaurant input dataset which uses latent vector collaborative filtering. This recommendation engine can be used to locate the restaurants if you are new to the city and also if you're not sure about what is best around. Also, this paper includes the types of recommendation engine and a brief overlook on this. Further we have tried two different methodologies in collaborative filtering and compared their outcomes.

Recommendation Systems:
Basically, there are two types of Recommendation Engine, they are:
1)	Collaborative filtering
2)	Content Based Filtering

	METHODOLOGY

We have developed restaurant recommendation engine by using two different algorithms, one is based on latent factor and second is Neighborhood-Based method. Both methods are type of collaborative recommendation system. Collaborative recommendation is method which is based on user reviews and rating given for product. So, for restaurant recommendation system we have used Yelp dataset for customerâ€™s reviews and built recommendation engine.
